# SPACE DUEL
A local multiplayer game where two spaceships are battling near a strange black hole that randomly spits out objects. Should the spaceships get too close however, the immense gravity of the blackhole sucks them in and teleports them to a random location on the level. Strangely, the black hole's gravity field doesn't affect the objects it launched.
